# This module allows setting the read pool connection type. Generally you will use one of
#
#   - use_random_read_connection
#   - use_persistent_read_connection
#   - use_master_connection
#
# Each of these methods can take an optional block. If they are called with a block, they
# will set the read connection type only within the block. Otherwise they will set the default
# read connection type. If none is ever called, the read connection type will be :master.
